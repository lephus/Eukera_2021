Autify’s AI detects any changes in the source code/UI and automatically corrects the test scenario at every run while its visual regression automatically detects and allows users to run tests without maintenance, based on its statement.</p>\n<p>With remote work becoming a standard in many companies globally, software developers and QA teams are finding it increasingly difficult to prepare and manage mobile devices for manual testing. Autify’s no-code for mobile allows anyone to easily create, execute and automate software test scenarios without programming knowledge or automation skills, just by operating their mobile app on a web browser. It doesn’t need to prepare real mobile devices with different combinations of operating systems, screen sizes, network operators, and user scenarios, Chikazawa said.</p>\n<p>Its newly launched “Autify for mobile” beta version improves the efficiency of testing mobile native applications, aiming to dramatically improve QA productivity by allowing users to manage testing for both web and mobile native applications on the same platform.</p>\n<p><a href='https://autify.com/'>Autify for web</a> launched in October 2019 and has a large number of B2C and B2B SaaS <a href='https://autify.com/why-autify'>customers</a> including Unity, DeNA and ZOZO in Japan, the U.S., Singapore as well as Europe, according to Chikizawa.</p>\n<p>The company is currently focusing on two markets, the U.S. and Japan, but plans to fuel further global expansion, Chikizawa said.</p>\n<p>“Autify had that global vision right from the start, and it is backed by a well-thought-out go-to-market strategy. Instead of customizing their solution only to Japanese users which tend to be hard to scale globally, Autify decided to design their solution by global standards from day one,” Kubota told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The software testing market is projected to increase by $60 billion by 2027, according to <a href='https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/software-testing-market'>research by Global Market Insights.</a></p>\n<p>“With 75% of global companies still manually performing software development tests, Autify is hoping to disrupt the $1.3 trillion global testing market by providing a no-code application for automated testing,” said Chikazawa. “Autify’s three-pronged approach to automation of testing — no-code, AI-powered and customer success — helps address the challenges that were plaguing the testing market for far too long, such as labor shortage, high maintenance cost and technical difficulty. The best part of all this is that Autify manages to address these issues without having to sacrifice product quality at any stage of the development.”</p>\n<p>“Autify can win in the testing market because lack of developers is not a Japan-only issue. For example, <a href='https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/software-developer-shortage-us#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,the%20market%20by%20that%20time.'>even in the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that by 2026, the shortage of engineers will exceed 1.2 million</a>,” Kubota said.</p>\n<p>Autify enables not just tech companies, but also companies across regions and industries that may not have enough technical staff to improve their software development, Kubota mentioned.</p>\n<p>Global consumer spending in mobile apps has reached $111 billion in 2020, with an increasing 30% year on year in 2019, and the market continues to grow at a rapid pace, as per its statement citing <a href='https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2020'>Sensor Tower</a>.</p>\n<div class='embed breakout'>\n<blockquote class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='4MUHq78Dn7'><p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/no-code-tool-maker-heyflow-nabs-6m-to-fix-your-customer-conversions/'>‘No-code’ tool maker, Heyflow, nabs $6M to fix your customer conversions</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='4MUHq78Dn7' frameborder='0' height='450' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' sandbox='allow-scripts' scrolling='no' security='restricted' src='https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/no-code-tool-maker-heyflow-nabs-6m-to-fix-your-customer-conversions/embed/#?secret=4MUHq78Dn7' style='position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);' title='“‘No-code’ tool maker, Heyflow, nabs $6M to fix your customer conversions” — TechCrunch' width='800'></iframe></p></div>\n<div class='embed breakout'>\n<blockquote class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='ewtxRD8H6e'><p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/leapwork-raises-10m-for-its-easy-process-automation-platform-plans-us-expansion/'>Leapwork raises $10M for its easy process automation platform, plans US expansion</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='ewtxRD8H6e' frameborder='0' height='450' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' sandbox='allow-scripts' scrolling='no' security='restricted' src='https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/leapwork-raises-10m-for-its-easy-process-automation-platform-plans-us-expansion/embed/#?secret=ewtxRD8H6e' style='position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);' title='“Leapwork raises $10M for its easy process automation platform, plans US expansion” — TechCrunch' width='800'></iframe></p></div>\n<div class='embed breakout'>\n<blockquote class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='aRa4dbpqeW'><p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/no-code-process-automation-platform-leapwork-fires-up-with-62m-series-b/'>‘No-code’ process automation platform, Leapwork, fires up with $62M Series B</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='aRa4dbpqeW' frameborder='0' height='450' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' sandbox='allow-scripts' scrolling='no' security='restricted' src='https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/no-code-process-automation-platform-leapwork-fires-up-with-62m-series-b/embed/#?secret=aRa4dbpqeW' style='position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);' title='“‘No-code’ process automation platform, Leapwork, fires up with $62M Series B” — TechCrunch' width='800'></iframe></p></div>\n</div>\n<footer class='article-footer'>\n<input class='shortlink' readonly='' title='Article Shortlink' type='text' value=''/>\n</footer>\n</article>\n</div>",

Couriers Union (ADCU) <a href='https://www.adcu.org.uk/news-posts/adcu-initiates-legal-action-against-ubers-workplace-use-of-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-systems'>announced the legal action</a> Tuesday, alleging that Uber’s biometric identity checks discriminate against people of color.</p>\n<p>The union said it’s taking the action after the unfair dismissal of a former Uber driver, Imran Javaid Raja, and a former Uber Eats courier, Pa Edrissa Manjang, following failed checks using the facial recognition technology.</p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, Yaseen Aslam, president of ADCU, said: “Last year Uber made a big claim that it was an anti-racist company and challenged all who tolerate racism to delete the app. But rather than root out racism Uber has bedded it into its systems and workers face discrimination daily as a result.”</p>\n<p>The ADCU is launching a <a href='https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/challenge-ubers-facialrec/'>crowdjustice campaign</a> to help fund the legal action — which it said is also being supported by the Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission and the not-for-profit Worker Info Exchange (WIE).</p>\n<p>The latter was set up by former Uber driver, James Farrer — who is now general secretary of ADCU and director of the WIE — and whose name should be familiar as he successfully sued Uber over its employment classification of UK drivers, forcing the company into a U-turn <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/'>earlier this year</a> when it finally announced it would treat drivers as workers after years trying to overturn successive employment tribunal rulings.</p>\n<p>Farrer’s next trick could be to bring a legal reckoning around the issue of algorithmic accountability in the so-called ‘gig economy’.</p><div class='piano-inline-promo'></div>\n<p>The action also looks timely as the <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/'>UK government is eyeing making changes</a> to the legal framework around data protection, which <a href='https://www.ft.com/content/519832b6-e22d-40bf-9971-1af3d3745821'>could extend to removing current protections</a> that wrap certain types of AI-driven decisions.</p>\n<div class='embed breakout'>\n<blockquote class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='s4gUmpfEq8'><p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/'>Uber hit with default ‘robo-firing’ ruling after another EU labor rights GDPR challenge</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='s4gUmpfEq8' frameborder='0' height='450' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' sandbox='allow-scripts' scrolling='no' security='restricted' src='https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/embed/#?secret=s4gUmpfEq8' style='position: absolute;

That followed an earlier suspension by the city’s transport regulator, TfL, which has raised safety concerns over its operations for years — branding Uber “not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence” in a shock denial of its licence four years ago.</p>\n<p>Despite losing its licence to operate in the UK capital all the way back in <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/'>2017</a>, Uber has been able to operate in the city continuously as it has appealed the regulatory action.</p>\n<p>It gained a <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/uber-wins-appeal-and-gets-a-provisional-15-month-license-to-operate-in-london/'>provisional 15-month licence in 2018 </a>— though not the full five year term. Later it got <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/uber-gets-temporary-two-month-license-reprieve-in-london/'>a two-month licence in 2019</a>, with a laundry list of operational conditions from TfL — before once again being denied a full licence renewal in <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/uber-has-again-been-denied-licence-renewal-in-london-over-safety-risks/'>November 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>Then in <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal/'>September 2020</a> Uber was granted a licence renewal — but, again, only for 18 months. So to say Uber’s UK business has been under pressure over safety for years is putting it mildly.</p>\n<p>The ADCU notes that in September 2020, when the Westminster Magistrates Court (most recently) renewed Uber’s license for London, it set a condition that the company must “maintain appropriate systems, processes and procedures to confirm that a driver using the app is an individual licensed by TfL and permitted by ULL to use the app”.</p>\n<p>“This condition facilitated the introduction of harmful facial recognition systems,” the ADCU argues.</p>\n<p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/'>Earlier this year </a>the ADCU and the WIE called for Microsoft to suspend Uber’s use of its <a href='https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/'>B2B facial recognition technology</a> — after finding multiple cases where drivers were mis-identified and went on to have their licence to operate revoked by TfL.</p>\n<p>Now the union says its lawyers will argue that facial recognition systems, including those operated by Uber, are “inherently faulty and generate particularly poor accuracy results when used with people of color”.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of Uber’s licence to operate in London the company reports failed driver identity checks to TfL — which can then revoke a driver’s licence, meaning he or she is unable to work as a private hire vehicle driver in the city.</p>\n<p>The ride hailing giant also appears to use the same real-time facial verification identity check technology for both Uber drivers and Uber Eats couriers — even though the latter are delivering food, not ferrying passengers around. And in one letter seen by TechCrunch, in which TfL writes to an Uber driver to inform him that it is revoking his private hire licence, the regulator makes reference to information provided by Uber regarding the driver’s dismissal as an Uber Eats courier on account of a failed ID check carried out by Uber’s sister company.</p>\n<p>That failed ID check as a food delivery courier then appears to be being used as grounds by TfL to justify revoking the same person’s private hire vehicle licence — on “public safety” grounds.</p>\n<p>“It is recognized that the failed checks did not occur on a private hire operator’s booking platform or while undertaking any bookings.

  "description": "Ride-hailing giant Uber is facing a legal challenge over its use of real-time facial recognition technology in a driver and courier identity check system that it uses in the UK.\nThe App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU) announced the legal action Tuesday, alleging that Uber’s biometric identity checks discriminate against people of color.\nThe union said it’s taking the action after the unfair dismissal of a former Uber driver, Imran Javaid Raja, and a former Uber Eats courier, Pa Edrissa Manjang, following failed checks using the facial recognition technology.\nCommenting in a statement, Yaseen Aslam, president of ADCU, said: “Last year Uber made a big claim that it was an anti-racist company and challenged all who tolerate racism to delete the app. But rather than root out racism Uber has bedded it into its systems and workers face discrimination daily as a result.”\nThe ADCU is launching a crowdjustice campaign to help fund the legal action — which it said is also being supported by the Equality & Human Rights Commission and the not-for-profit Worker Info Exchange (WIE).\nThe latter was set up by former Uber driver, James Farrer — who is now general secretary of ADCU and director of the WIE — and whose name should be familiar as he successfully sued Uber over its employment classification of UK drivers, forcing the company into a U-turn earlier this year when it finally announced it would treat drivers as workers after years trying to overturn successive employment tribunal rulings.\nFarrer’s next trick could be to bring a legal reckoning around the issue of algorithmic accountability in the so-called ‘gig economy’.\nThe action also looks timely as the UK government is eyeing making changes to the legal framework around data protection, which could extend to removing current protections that wrap certain types of AI-driven decisions.\n\nUber hit with default ‘robo-firing’ ruling after another EU labor rights GDPR challenge\n\n“Workers are prompted to provide a real-time selfie and face dismissal if the system fails to match the selfie with a stored reference photo,” the ADCU writes in a press release explaining how drivers experience Uber’s system. “In turn, private hire drivers who have been dismissed also faced automatic revocation of their private hire driver and vehicle licenses by Transport for London.”\nThe union says Uber’s real-time facial recognition checks, which incorporate Microsoft’s FACE API technology, have been in use by the ride hailing platform in the UK since March 2020.\nUber introduced the selfie identity checks ahead of another hearing over its licence renewal in London. That followed an earlier suspension by the city’s transport regulator, TfL, which has raised safety concerns over its operations for years — branding Uber “not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence” in a shock denial of its licence four years ago.\nDespite losing its licence to operate in the UK capital all the way back in 2017, Uber has been able to operate in the city continuously as it has appealed the regulatory action.\nIt gained a provisional 15-month licence in 2018 — though not the full five year term. Later it got a two-month licence in 2019, with a laundry list of operational conditions from TfL — before once again being denied a full licence renewal in November 2019.\nThen in September 2020 Uber was granted a licence renewal — but, again, only for 18 months. So to say Uber’s UK business has been under pressure over safety for years is putting it mildly.\nThe ADCU notes that in September 2020, when the Westminster Magistrates Court (most recently) renewed Uber’s license for London, it set a condition that the company must “maintain appropriate systems, processes and procedures to confirm that a driver using the app is an individual licensed by TfL and permitted by ULL to use the app”.\n“This condition facilitated the introduction of harmful facial recognition systems,” the ADCU argues.\nEarlier this year the ADCU and the WIE called for Microsoft to suspend Uber’s use of its B2B facial recognition technology — after finding multiple cases where drivers were mis-identified and went on to have their licence to operate revoked by TfL.\nNow the union says its lawyers will argue that facial recognition systems, including those operated by Uber, are “inherently faulty and generate particularly poor accuracy results when used with people of color”.\nUnder the terms of Uber’s licence to operate in London the company reports failed driver identity checks to TfL — which can then revoke a driver’s licence, meaning he or she is unable to work as a private hire vehicle driver in the city.\nThe ride hailing giant also appears to use the same real-time facial verification identity check technology for both Uber drivers and Uber Eats couriers — even though the latter are delivering food, not ferrying passengers around.

We can take [emmy’s] user base of more than 300,000 people, and using GoTo technology, convert this company from a mono-vertical to a multimodal, and immediately start to offer them cars and other micromobility options, short trips and long trips.”</p>\n<p>As part of the acquisition, GoTo also takes on emmy’s debts. In April, <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/'>shared mobility software company Wunder Mobility launched a lending service</a> and announced plans to help emmy finance 1,500 retrofitted Yadea scooters, which will now be GoTo’s responsibility to pay back.

The company also recently raised rounds totaling $22.5 million and is currently raising more to help it expand into Italy, Netherlands and Portugal in the next year, according to Laser.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is to be the Netflix of mobility,” Laser told TechCrunch. “In the end users will pay us X amount of dollars and you get free rides on whichever vehicle you want.”</p>\n<p>Until such a point, the company has to establish a presence and brand loyalty. Laser says multimodality that includes car rentals is the company’s secret sauce for success, part of a strategy that has led GoTo to be profitable and cashflow positive in its most mature market of Israel. The company hopes the strategy will also translate to an annual revenue that exceeds $116 million by the end of 2023.</p><div class='piano-inline-promo'></div>\n<p>It’s a balancing act between the cost of user acquisition and how much money you can generate from a user, says Laser. Shared micromobility companies have a low cost of acquisition because they just put their assets all over the streets, people see them, download the app and then they’re a customer. The problem is that the revenue per each user (RPU) is usually low, in large part because there’s no difference in service between companies, and therefore no loyalty, according to Laser.</p>\n<p>Car rental companies have a different problem. They have a higher RPU because you can charge $20 to $30 per ride, but the marketing costs to acquire a user is really high.</p>\n<p>“How we solve this problem is the multimodality philosophy,” said Laser. “We convert the user to use more and more services. Like you came to the supermarket to buy veggies but then you also end up buying meat and milk.”</p>\n<p>One way the company does this is through a variety of promotion-type schemes. For example, Laser says GoTo charges €3 for the first 15 minutes of any ride on any vehicle. If a new user comes on to book a ride on a scooter and adds €3 to their wallet, they might automatically see €9 in the wallet that can be used toward the purchase of a car ride. This alerts the user to other use cases and, hopefully, creates brand loyalty in a way that’s cheaper than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising with Google and Facebook, says Laser.</p>\n<p>The result so far has been 90% of B2C revenue comes from return users, and 41% of all customers are multimodal users. Part of this might also be due to the fact that GoTo also charges a membership, which can range from around $2 to $7, to use its service.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve healthy unit economics, the company also combines owning and leasing assets.</p>\n<p>“In the end our product is more efficient,” said Laser. “By not owning the assets, we enjoy the arbitrage from taking a car or moped and renting it for two years and renting it back to our users for two minutes, and by doing that we can gain a lot of profit.”</p>\n<p>GoTo has MoUs with Renault, Toyota, Nio and Segway. It currently leases its cars and mopeds and owns its own smaller micromobility vehicles, but hopes to lease those, too, in the future. However, one of the main problems micromobility operators have faced has been the way shared assets depreciate very quickly, so it’s hard to imagine a scooter manufacturer wanting to own the asset and not generate rental revenue from it.</p>\n<p>One way to make that scheme work would be to have really high utilization rates, which requires different types of demand that peaks at different hours. Aside from its main customer base of commuters, GoTo is actively targeting business customers through three different models. The first and second is to get companies to offer employees benefits in the form of either subscriptions or mobility wallets. The third is for companies to reserve dedicated fleets for their employees, usually between specific work hours like from 8am to 6pm. After 6pm, the fleets would go back to being available for communities, says Laser. Business customers currently make up 13% of GoTo’s revenue, but the goal is to boost that up to 50% by 2025.</p>\n<p style='font-weight: 400;'>“We are today on course to register 100% year on year growth in 2021 and we know that GoTo’s multimodal mobility experience means we can hit right at the heart of the urban mobility problem,” said Laser. “Today we assume to be at least 30-36 months ahead of other platforms and offerings in the market.”</p>\n</div>\n<footer class='article-footer'>\n<input class='shortlink' readonly='' title='Article Shortlink' type='text' value=''/>\n</footer>\n</article>\n</div>",

Part of this might also be due to the fact that GoTo also charges a membership, which can range from around $2 to $7, to use its service.\nIn order to achieve healthy unit economics, the company also combines owning and leasing assets.\n“In the end our product is more efficient,” said Laser. “By not owning the assets, we enjoy the arbitrage from taking a car or moped and renting it for two years and renting it back to our users for two minutes, and by doing that we can gain a lot of profit.”\nGoTo has MoUs with Renault, Toyota, Nio and Segway. It currently leases its cars and mopeds and owns its own smaller micromobility vehicles, but hopes to lease those, too, in the future. However, one of the main problems micromobility operators have faced has been the way shared assets depreciate very quickly, so it’s hard to imagine a scooter manufacturer wanting to own the asset and not generate rental revenue from it.\nOne way to make that scheme work would be to have really high utilization rates, which requires different types of demand that peaks at different hours. Aside from its main customer base of commuters, GoTo is actively targeting business customers through three different models. The first and second is to get companies to offer employees benefits in the form of either subscriptions or mobility wallets. The third is for companies to reserve dedicated fleets for their employees, usually between specific work hours like from 8am to 6pm. After 6pm, the fleets would go back to being available for communities, says Laser. Business customers currently make up 13% of GoTo’s revenue, but the goal is to boost that up to 50% by 2025.\n“We are today on course to register 100% year on year growth in 2021 and we know that GoTo’s multimodal mobility experience means we can hit right at the heart of the urban mobility problem,” said Laser. “Today we assume to be at least 30-36 months ahead of other platforms and offerings in the market.”",

  "description": "I have worked in startups for more than half of my life, and for most of that time, I was the only Black person in the room. As a result, the lack of representation in tech isn’t abstract to me.\nBesides my experience, I read and talk about diversity in tech every day, so when I was offered a chance to speak to three founders from underrepresented groups at TechCrunch Disrupt, I was eager for the opportunity.\nI was joined by Hana Mohan, a transgender woman who is the CEO and co-founder of MagicBell; Leslie Feinzaig, a Latina entrepreneur who started the Female Founders Alliance; and Stephen Bailey, a Black man who is the founder and CEO of ExecOnline, an online leadership development platform.\n\nFull TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members.\nUse discount code TCPLUSROUNDUP to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.\n\nEvery entrepreneur swims against a current, but these founders face challenges that their white, male counterparts do not.\nEach of them has cracked the code that grants access to capital and influential social networks, but I also wanted to learn about how they approached leadership and management, hear some of their strategies for building confidence and find out whether generic best practices for startup success applied to their lived experiences.\nThanks again to the panelists who joined me. We went slightly over our allotted time, but it was a candid discussion that uncovered some unique perspectives. I picked out some of the highlights for the recap, but there’s a video that captures the entire chat.\nHave a great week, and thanks for reading TechCrunch+!\nWalter Thompson\nSenior Editor, TechCrunch+\n@yourprotagonist\n\n3 founders share strategies for navigating bias and building confidence\n\nWhere and when to spend your recently raised dollars\nImage Credits: PM Images / Getty Images\nStartups have lots of options when it comes to fundraising, with “ample capital, a focus on distributed investing [and] more first-check investors than ever before,” Natasha Mascarenhas writes.\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt, Harlem Capital’s Henri Pierre-Jacques and BBG Ventures’ Nisha Dua explained how founders should allocate recently raised dollars in today’s environment.\n“It’s easier to raise and harder to spend these days, because there’s such a high demand for talent,” Dua said. “The answer for where to spend is going to be different for every company across many different industries.”\n\nWhere and when to spend your recently raised dollars\n\nBattery chemistry company Sila’s founder Gene Berdichevsky on the science of scaling up\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin\nAs part of an ongoing series of interviews with founders of transportation companies, Rebecca Bellan spoke to Sila Nano founder Gene Berdichevsky about his company’s efforts to build and scale the next generation of EV batteries.\n“We want to be a world leader and do for the energy storage industry what Intel did for the personal computing industry,” he said.\n“Intel didn’t make every single chip or the motherboards or the PCs. They made the most important components whose performance drove the adoption of the devices people actually wanted, and the better the microprocessor got, the better computers got, the more people used them and the more the world changed.”\n\nBattery chemistry company Sila’s founder Gene Berdichevsky on the science of scaling up\n\nWhat you should know about working with corporate venture investment committees\nImage Credits: syolacan (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\nMost founders are exclusively focused on getting a check from a private VC firm, but in the first half of this year, corporate venture capital funding totaled $79 billion across 2,099 deals globally.\nIn a guest post for TechCrunch+, WIND Ventures’ Brian Walsh explains key differences between CVC and VC and shares his basic best practices for getting a “yes” out of a corporate investment committee.\nIt’s a different environment, but there are “great opportunities with this growing investor set,” he writes.\n“By understanding the roles, processes and how to help get their deal through a CVC IC, all parties stand to benefit.”\n\nWhat you should know about working with corporate venture investment committees\n\nEvil Geniuses CEO on the path toward esports ubiquity\nImage Credits: John McCoy / Getty Images\nThe esports league Evil Geniuses (EG) was founded in 1999, but at TechCrunch Disrupt, CEO Nicole LaPointe Jameson told Lucas Matney that the industry is still in its infancy.\n“Today, it’s a bit of a dance to bridge the understanding for some of the older generations that have negative perceptions of what gaming is, which often aren’t factually correct,” she said.\n“I am a complete optimist around the younger generations — I don’t believe esports will be perceived as a niche sport for younger audiences.”\n\nEvil Geniuses CEO on the path toward esports ubiquity\n\nInvestors share how infrastructure as code is taking over DevOps\nImage Credits: Erik Isakson (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\n“Infrastructure as code (IaC) has been gaining wider adoption among DevOps teams in recent years, but the complexities of data center configuration and management continue to create problems — and opportunities,” Karan Bhasin writes.\nHe surveyed top investors in IaC startups to find out more:\n\nSheila Gulati, managing director, Tola Capital\nS. Somasegar, managing director, Madrona Venture Group\nAaron Jacobson, partner, New Enterprise Associates\nSri Pangulur, partner, Tribe Capital\nTeddie Wardi, managing director, Insight Partners\nTim Tully, partner, Menlo Ventures\n\n\nInvestors share how infrastructure as code is taking over DevOps\n\nInformatica’s IPO will test public markets’ appetite for slower-growing tech offerings\nImage Credits: matejmo / Getty Images\nSix years after a PE firm took it private, Informatica filed to go public last week at a valuation reportedly as high as $10 billion.\n“A number that big demands exploration,” declared Alex Wilhelm, who pored over the S-1 with great interest yesterday afternoon.\n“If investors can get to a point where they consider that the company’s subscription revenues are set for long-term growth, a 7x multiple doesn’t seem too wild,” he writes.\n\nInformatica’s IPO will test public markets’ appetite for slower-growing tech offerings\n\nIndex, Sequoia and Canvas investors weigh in on how to raise your first dollars\nImage Credits: RapidEye (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\n“Founders seeking to raise their first round of capital may feel overwhelmed by the prospect,” Mary Ann Azevedo writes. “There is definitely plenty of capital out there, but there are also a lot of startups clamoring for it.”\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt, three investors unpacked this dilemma, sharing insider tips that will help entrepreneurs clarify their thinking, forge closer partnerships with investors and reset their expectations.\n\nNina Achadijan, partner, Index Ventures\nRebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner, Canvas Ventures\nLuciana Lixandru, partner, Sequoia Capital\n\n\nIndex, Sequoia and Canvas investors weigh in on how to raise your first dollars\n\nAs Apple messes with attribution, what does growth marketing look like in 2021?\nImage Credits: NurPhoto (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\nApple rolled out app tracking transparency in April, giving users the ability to stop their phones from sharing data about their behavior.\nMore recently, changes in iOS 15 permitted consumers to opt into mail privacy protection and exert additional control over app permissions.\nThis is all great news for privacy-minded consumers, but for startups that live and die by their ability to measure growth and engagement, there’s confusion and uncertainty.\nTo learn more about how growth marketers are recalibrating data collection, Managing Editor Danny Crichton interviewed three experts at TechCrunch Disrupt:\n\nJenifer Ho, VP marketing, Elation Health\nShoji Ueki, head of marketing and analytics, Point\nNik Sharma, owner, Sharma Brands\n\n\nAs Apple messes with attribution, what does growth marketing look like in 2021?\n\nWhy and when startups should look to diverse sources of capital\nImage Credits: Hill Street Studios (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\nIs chasing venture capital the right choice for your startup, or are you doing it because it’s what’s expected?\n“Venture capital is a popular source of capital for early-stage startups, but it’s definitely not the only one,” Mary Ann Azevedo writes. “Debt is an increasingly popular alternative, as is non-dilutive, revenue-based financing.”\nShe spoke with three experts at TechCrunch Disrupt to discuss the various ways companies can raise capital and which might be the best avenue for startups:\n\nArun Mathew, partner, Accel\nMichele Romanow, co-founder and president, Clearco\nHarry Hurst, co-founder and co-CEO, Pipe\n\n“We’re very bullish about some of the categories that haven’t traditionally got as much funding,” said Romanow. “We just think that you should think about what you’re spending the money for, and maybe use cheaper capital for those repeatable expenses.”\n\nWhy and when startups should look to diverse sources of capital\n\nChamath Palihapitiya speaks to SPAC concerns, from fees to disclosures to quality\nImage Credits: Michael Kovac / Getty Images\nInvestor Chamath Palihapitiya has formed at least 10 special purpose acquisition companies so far: The New Yorker dubbed him the “Pied Piper of SPACs,” while Bloomberg crowned him “King of SPACs.”\nConnie Loizos spoke to him at TechCrunch Disrupt about some of the downsides of SPAC financing that have given concern to many, such as corporate disclosures. “I think the big concern with SPACs is there’s a lot of pixie dust,” she said.\nPalihapitiya’s response:\nIf you look at social media, there was Facebook, and then there [were] a bunch of other crappy social networks that went out of business. I think SPAC sponsorship will look the same way. I think there will be a handful of groups that prove consistently through their actions that they are doing a great job for investors, for disclosure, for regulators [and] for these companies…\n\nChamath Palihapitiya speaks to SPAC concerns, from fees to disclosures to quality\n\n7 takeaways from Rivian’s IPO filing\nImage Credits: Kirsten Korosec\nTransportation Editor Kirsten Korosec and Alex Wilhelm reviewed the IPO for electric vehicle company Rivian and shared seven takeaways.\nBuilding an EV company is costly; so far the company has raised nearly $11 billion and employs around 8,000 people. And it’s just getting started.\nKirsten and Alex reviewed Rivian’s operating results going back to 2019 and found much to discuss — everything except revenue, that is.\nIt doesn’t exist because Rivian has essentially zero historical revenues to report; that of course makes sense because Rivian is just starting to deliver the first R1T trucks (revenue yay!) to customers. You can spy a dribble of income in the interest section, but that’s effectively it; Rivian has only made money thus far from simply having lots of cash, some of which generated a paltry return.\n\n7 takeaways from Rivian’s IPO filing\n\nThe first win: Getting early customers to take a chance with you\nImage Credits: mikkelwilliam (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\nThere’s a reason why business owners frame the first dollar they earn: It recognizes their own effort, but it also pays tribute to the customer who decided to give them a chance.\n“You may be looking ahead to raising some funds and trying to juggle the administrative aspects of running a business, but before all that, the purpose of your company is to sell your solution and generate revenue,” writes Ron Miller.\n“But to do that requires customers, so how do you get someone to take a chance with you?”\nTo answer that question, he interviewed three industry veterans at TechCrunch Disrupt:\n\nKate Taylor, head of customer experience, Notion\nPablo Viguera, co-CEO and co-founder, Belvo\nVineet Jain, CEO and co-founder, Egnyte\n\n\nThe first win: Getting early customers to take a chance with you\n\nReid Hoffman on the evolution of ‘blitzscaling’ amid the pandemic\nImage Credits: Kelly Sullivan/Getty Images for LinkedIn\nLike many buzzwords in tech circles, “blitzscaling” has taken on a life of its own since it was coined by Greylock partner and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.\n“Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal,” he clarified during TechCrunch Disrupt.\n“Blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things.”\n\nReid Hoffman on the evolution of ‘blitzscaling’ amid the pandemic\n\n​​What a community means in the modern world of startups\nImage Credits: enviromantic (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\nWhen I worked as a community manager, it quickly became apparent that each company I worked at had different ideas about what “community” meant.\nIs it a function of customer service? Marketing? Should product teams work to promote it? What’s the best way to measure it?\n“What, precisely, do we mean when we use the word ‘community’ in the world of startups?” Brian Heater asked the members of his TechCrunch Disrupt panel:\n\nAlex Angel, chief community officer, Commsor\nLolita Taub, corporate Development VP at Catalyte, co-founder and general partner, The Community Fund\nKatelin Holloway, 776 founding partner\n\n\nWhat a community means in the modern world of startups\n\nWho needs a BaaS partner, anyway?\nImage Credits: Klaus Vedfelt (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\nBanking-as-a-service (BaaS) startups tap into banking infrastructure, which makes it easier for developers to create tools that facilitate payments and transfers. As Ryan Lawler noted recently, it’s never been easier to offer your own credit card.\nTo get a better understanding of the problem BaaS providers are trying to solve, Ryan spoke with several founders in this space, including:\n\nUnit CEO Itai Damti\nBond CEO Roy Ng\nSynctera CEO Peter Hazlehurst\n\n“Unless you’re super deep in financial services already, the time and effort required to figure it out yourself is not worth it and you will never get a great deal,” Hazlehurst said.\n\nWho needs a BaaS partner, anyway?",

Davis stuck to Facebook’s script, frustrating senators as she failed to answer questions directly. But Haugen, a former project manager on civic misinformation at Facebook, was predictably more forthcoming with information.</p>\n<p>Haugen is an algorithm specialist, having served as a project manager at companies like Google, Pinterest and Yelp. While she was at Facebook, she addressed issues related to democracy, misinformation and counter-espionage.</p>\n<p>“Having worked on four different types of social networks, I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are,” Haugen said in her opening statement. “However, the choices being made inside Facebook are disastrous — for our children, for our public safety, for our privacy and for our democracy — and that is why we must demand Facebook make changes.”</p>\n<h2>The algorithm</h2>\n<p>Throughout the hearing, Haugen made clear that she thinks that Facebook’s current algorithm, which rewards posts that generate meaningful social interactions (MSIs), is dangerous. <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/11/facebook-time-well-spent/'>Rolled out</a> in 2018, this news feed algorithm prioritizes interactions (such as comments and likes) from the people who Facebook thinks you’re closest to, like friends and family.</p>\n<p>But as <a href='https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215'>the documents leaked</a> by Haugen show, data scientists raised concerns that this system yielded “unhealthy side effects on important slices of public content, such as politics and news.”</p>\n<p>Facebook also uses engagement-based ranking, in which an AI displays the content that it thinks will be most interesting to individual users.

Facebook implemented safeguards to reduce misinformation ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. After the election, it turned off those safeguards. But after the attacks on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, Facebook switched them back on again.</p>\n<p>“Facebook changed those safety defaults in the run up to the election because they knew they were dangerous. Because they wanted that growth back after the election, they returned to their original defaults,” Haugen said. “I think that’s deeply problematic.”</p>\n<p>Haugen said that Facebook is emphasizing a false choice — that they can either use their volatile algorithms and continue their rapid growth, or they can prioritize user safety and decline. But she thinks that adopting more safety measures, like oversight from academics, researchers and government agencies, could actually help Facebook’s bottom line.</p>\n<p>“The thing I’m asking for is a move [away] from short-term-ism, which is what Facebook is run under today. It’s being led by metrics and not people,” Haugen said. “With appropriate oversight and some of these constraints, it’s possible that Facebook could actually be a much more profitable company five or 10 years down the road, because it wasn’t as toxic, and not as many people quit it.”</p>\n<h2>Establishing government oversight</h2>\n<p>When asked as a “thought experiment” what she would do if she were in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s shoes, Haugen said she would establish policies about sharing information with oversight bodies including Congress; she would work with academics to make sure they have the information they need to conduct research about the platform; and that she would immediately implement the “soft interventions” that were identified to protect the integrity of the 2020 election. She suggested requiring users to click on a link before they share it, since other <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/'>companies like Twitter</a> have found these interventions to reduce misinformation.</p>\n<p>Haugen also added that she thinks Facebook as it’s currently structured can’t prevent the spread of vaccine misinformation, since the company is overly reliant on AI systems that Facebook itself says will likely never catch more than 10% to 20% of content.</p>\n<p>Later on, Haugen told the committee that she “strongly encourages” reforming Section 230, a part of the United States Communications Decency Act that absolves social media platforms from being held liable for what their users post. Haugen thinks Section 230 should exempt decisions about algorithms, making it possible for companies to face legal consequences if their algorithms are found to cause harm.</p>\n<p>“User-generated content is something companies have less control over. But they have 100% control over their algorithms,” Haugen said. “Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritize growth, virality and reactiveness over public safety.”</p>\n<p>Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) asked how Facebook’s bottom line would be impacted if the algorithm promoted safety. Haugen said that it would have an impact, because when users see more engaging content (even if it’s more enraging than engaging), they spend more time on the platform, yielding more ad dollars for Facebook. But she thinks the platform would still be profitable if it followed the steps she outlined for improving user safety.</p>\n<div class='embed breakout'>\n<blockquote class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='0kuMZAFMFC'><p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/'>Facebook grilled in Senate hearing over teen mental health</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class='wp-embedded-content' data-secret='0kuMZAFMFC' frameborder='0' height='450' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' sandbox='allow-scripts' scrolling='no' security='restricted' src='https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/embed/#?secret=0kuMZAFMFC' style='position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);' title='“Facebook grilled in Senate hearing over teen mental health” — TechCrunch' width='800'></iframe></p></div>\n<h2>International security</h2>\n<p>As <a href='https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953?mod=article_inline'>reported</a> in one of The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files stories, Facebook employees flagged instances of the platform being used for violent crime overseas, but the company’s response was inadequate, according to the documents Haugen leaked.</p>\n<p>Employees raised concerns, for example, about armed groups in Ethiopia using the platform to coordinate violent attacks against ethnic minorities.

  "description": "After revealing her identity on Sunday night, Frances Haugen — the whistleblower who leaked controversial Facebook documents to The Wall Street Journal — testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on Tuesday.\nHaugen’s testimony came after a hearing last week, when Facebook global head of Safety Antigone Davis was questioned about the company’s negative impact on children and teens. Davis stuck to Facebook’s script, frustrating senators as she failed to answer questions directly. But Haugen, a former project manager on civic misinformation at Facebook, was predictably more forthcoming with information.\nHaugen is an algorithm specialist, having served as a project manager at companies like Google, Pinterest and Yelp. While she was at Facebook, she addressed issues related to democracy, misinformation and counter-espionage.\n“Having worked on four different types of social networks, I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are,” Haugen said in her opening statement. “However, the choices being made inside Facebook are disastrous — for our children, for our public safety, for our privacy and for our democracy — and that is why we must demand Facebook make changes.”\nThe algorithm\nThroughout the hearing, Haugen made clear that she thinks that Facebook’s current algorithm, which rewards posts that generate meaningful social interactions (MSIs), is dangerous. Rolled out in 2018, this news feed algorithm prioritizes interactions (such as comments and likes) from the people who Facebook thinks you’re closest to, like friends and family.\nBut as the documents leaked by Haugen show, data scientists raised concerns that this system yielded “unhealthy side effects on important slices of public content, such as politics and news.”\nFacebook also uses engagement-based ranking, in which an AI displays the content that it thinks will be most interesting to individual users. This means content that elicits stronger reactions from users will be prioritized, boosting misinformation, toxicity and violent content. Haugen said she thinks that chronological ranking would help mitigate these negative impacts.\n“I’ve spent most of my career working on systems like engagement-based ranking. When I come to you and say these things, I’m basically damning 10 years of my own work,” Haugen said in the hearing.\nCommittee Senators listen as former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen (center) testifies before a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing on Capitol Hill, October 5, 2021, in Washington, DC.

  "description": "More people have begun turning to venture investing as a full-time pursuit, only to discover that it’s not as easy as it looks. That realization explains the rise of Oper8r, a for-profit, venture-backed accelerator that launched last year as a kind of Y Combinator for emerging fund managers. It explains the broad appeal of AngelList, which handles a lot of the hassle of fund administration in exchange for a fee.\nNow, Plexo Capital, which is both a venture firm and an outfit that backs other venture funds, is taking the wraps off its own program to help educate investors on the many facets involved in everything from forming a fund, to raising capital, to properly managing those assets.\nCalled, GPx, the program features an impressive number of free, educational modules that have been recorded by a long list of esteemed VCs and limited partners, including Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures, Michael Seibel of Y Combinator and Beezer Clarkson of Sapphire Ventures. But the program is also organized around cohorts into which a select number of emerging fund managers is invited to work more closely with course instructors, service providers (like law firms) and subject matter experts.\nNotably, GPx is a not-for-profit program but rather sponsored entirely by Alphabet (which is Plexo Capital’s anchor investor), City National Bank, Practical VC, and the global law firm Gunderson Dettmer. The presumed benefit to Plexo Capital is that it gives the firm better insight into managers it might want to fund, but to learn more, we caught up quickly yesterday with firm founder Lo Toney. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.\nTC: What’s the overarching objective here?\nLT: I would say our objective is to really add as much value as we can as an LP. When I started Plexo Capital, coming out GV [where Toney was an investor previously], I realized there were so many resources that we had there. I didn’t have to think about a lot of the back office because there were finance and legal and operations teams to handle all the things related to reporting and putting together docs for deals.

When I went out to start Plexo Capital, [it was eye-opening].\nWhat is the advantage to you in putting together this platform? Do you get a stake in the managers accepted into the cohort?\nThere are a couple of advantages that we take very seriously.

From there the spacecraft will have a long and winding journey: It will travel 3.6 billion kilometers over five years, boomeranging around both Venus and Earth to build enough velocity to eventually arrive at the asteroid belt beyond Mars in 2030. The UAE aims to land the spacecraft on an asteroid in 2033 — an ambitious target for a country that only founded its space agency in 2014.</p>\n<p>If successful, the UAE Space Agency would join a very small group — including NASA, the European Space Agency and Japan’s space agency JAXA — in landing a vehicle on a planetoid. The exact scientific goals of the mission will be announced next year, but any data the spacecraft collects could help deepen our understanding of the origins of the universe.

  "description": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Space Agency will be sending a probe to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with the aim of ultimately landing on an asteroid in the early 2030s, in a mission that will surely be a major boost for the country’s private sector space companies.\nThe mission will launch in 2028. From there the spacecraft will have a long and winding journey: It will travel 3.6 billion kilometers over five years, boomeranging around both Venus and Earth to build enough velocity to eventually arrive at the asteroid belt beyond Mars in 2030. The UAE aims to land the spacecraft on an asteroid in 2033 — an ambitious target for a country that only founded its space agency in 2014.\nIf successful, the UAE Space Agency would join a very small group — including NASA, the European Space Agency and Japan’s space agency JAXA — in landing a vehicle on a planetoid. The exact scientific goals of the mission will be announced next year, but any data the spacecraft collects could help deepen our understanding of the origins of the universe. That’s because asteroids are thought by some scientists to be celestial leftovers from when the solar system was formed.\nThis is the latest, and most ambitious, effort from the UAE, which has been aiming to boost its domestic space sector. Crucially, the UAE will give priority access to contracts and procurement to Emirari companies, which stand to benefit from the project.\nLast year, the country launched the Emirates Mars Mission Hope probe, which went into orbit around Mars in February of this year.

Founded in 2009 by Joshua Davidson when he was 16 years old, the Philadelphia-based company has worked on the launch of over 350 digital products to date. Clients range from big companies like Six Flags Great Adventure, to startups like SLAY, a fitness app by Mari Llewellyn, and nonprofits like Village Pledge, which is working to eliminate student-loan debt.</p>\n<p>We sat down with Joshua to learn more about the company, why it does more than just software consulting, and how startups can best work with it, as part of <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/who-are-the-best-software-development-consultants-for-startups/'>our new series profiling great startup software consultants</a>. The answers aren’t as straightforward as you might think they would be, but Joshua walked us through a few different scenarios where it would make sense to reach out to them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style='text-align: center;'><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>\n<p style='text-align: center;'><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href='https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl'>this quick survey</a> and we’ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What is <a href='https://chopdawg.com/'>Chop Dawg</a> and how did you get started?</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve been around since August of 2009. So, in dog years we’re pretty old. On paper, we are an app development agency, but we actually consider ourselves to be a technology-based company because we’ve really transcended beyond just traditional mobile apps and web apps. We call ourselves a technology company because we like to look at it, we are very agnostic anywhere that software could be, we try to build and cater for; which is really exciting and fun for us. In our case, we deal with really two types of audiences. So a huge segment of who we work with for are early-stage brand new startups and companies, and we help them bring their ideas to life and we do that all under one roof, but then we also work with existing companies that are typically not on a technical nature or missing a piece that requires a technical branch. In essence what we try to do is be like a Swiss Army knife so everything from, if you need everything from us we have that capability to if you just need us for design or if you just need us for programming.</p><div class='piano-inline-promo'></div>\n<p><strong>Chop Dawg does more than just building programming — you do marketing and fundraising, you’ll help with and attract media attention. What led you to be more than just programming? </strong></p>\n<p>It’s almost like a civic duty. I think that’s the only way I can articulate it. For every technical entrepreneur trying to build a tech product in this day and age, there are 10 non-technical individuals trying to do the same thing. Except for lack of technical insight, there’s usually folks who are seasoned entrepreneurs or know what technology can do and how it can solve for your industry. Their expertise is missing. For example, right now we are working with a music producer who’s trying to solve a huge problem in his industry. He produces for some of the biggest artists on the planet. He can’t build an app, but he knows exactly what type of technology to use and how it could [be used] to disrupt an industry. So it was more than realizing, oh my goodness, there’s this huge segment that’s just not getting help. And if you put yourself in their shoes, well they’re going to reach out to the app agencies. Most organizations are focusing on expertise and knowledge, or just, “OK here’s a bill for what you want to do,” and we wanted to make sure when we started a company like this is our craft. We want to build things that are going to be successful for the long haul. If we can help you with every aspect of this, we’re going to increase your probability of success, and if we can make you more knowledgeable, we can increase your probability for success, and if we can act more as kind of like your outsourced CTO and technical team, we can take away an area that’s already a conceived liability for you.</p>\n<p>For us it was like, this makes more sense of this approach. You know I’m not naive. We aren’t cheap because of the service we provide, we pay real people’s salaries, we have everything under one roof, but our job is to produce ROI. Make an asset that we scale for the long term and do it where someone is going to invest money, time and resources into it. You’re going to have the highest probability of success. It just came down to that kind of context. So I like to look at it like it just feels like our ethical or fiducial obligation. In the industry, there’s so much saturation, there’s so much competitiveness, and being around as long as we have, we have seen so many companies come and go. I think the reason we’ve had that longevity is just because we’ve always come in with a partnership first approach — but to be frank, we do that even when it’s not startups and early-stage companies, I just think there’s a huge knowledge gap and we have a lot of things we’ve learned — what to do, what not to do, and we can use that as an area of expertise to help folks we work with.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes Chop Dawg unique?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the biggest thing at this point is our track record itself. We’ve been around since the early days, and we have maintained relevancy. If you asked one of our partners, that’s what we call our clients, I think what they’re going to tell you is that longevity allows us to tell people not just what to do, but that we know why to do it that way, and how to be more pragmatic — save time, save energy, but also know what not to do. From being around so long, we’ve probably made every mistake you can possibly think of. Which is an advantage. Once you know that lesson, we can also help folks avoid that mistake. I think the third piece and this is more my personal bias that says this, more than anything, but I genuinely do believe it. We are industry agnostic, we’ve worked in almost every industry you can literally think of. I mean professional cuddling is really in our portfolio at this point. We’ve done it all. What’s cool is you start learning that there are trends and playbooks that work in different industries that can be brought to an industry not done before. It’s such a saturated market a lot of folks really are focusing on, and I just don’t think they focus with the right intention. For us, like I think most people on our team if they could work for free to do it for free would, but you know, the reality of living in a capitalist society. We come in with that, have a background like this is the craft level we do and we get to build things we’re proud of and work with people we really love working with.</p>\n<p><strong>What trends are you seeing right now in the industry?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the first thing is using AI. I think, as a user, we expect our products to just do things intuitively for us more than ever before. Social is in almost everything at this point. It’s crazy to think that we’re building social base functionality in even internal apps for organizations. There is not a single app I can think of that we’re building right now that doesn’t have some form of social element involved, which makes perfect sense to me as being social beings, making technology being an extension of ourselves and just more industry niche-based products at this point. One more trend of notice is that there’s a cliche in business called “riches in the niches,” but I think you’re really starting to see this now in the app world, where instead of one app eats the entire world, so to speak, there’s a lot more companies that are focusing on just owning a niche and being absolutely best at it and then having minimal competition — no competitors, things like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Has the pandemic affected the trends that you’re seeing?</strong></p>\n<p>The thing it has impacted is a lot of folks, who I feel like probably would have been a little bit more hesitant to go build apps and software, are now going in. I think it’s just jump=started the industry, like “Oh snap, we might never have a full office again,” our customer base or user base is less probable to come out, or they have a different type of learned behavior now because of a year living through Zoom and not leaving your home. So there is no direct trend as far as like, here’s these type of apps and software coming. I think the trend is more you’re seeing organizations and companies and ideas come out that maybe would have taken a couple more years to make that jump. While I can’t share who they are because of an NDA, I talked to a nonprofit yesterday, who, if it wasn’t for the pandemic, they would have never been entertaining, “we need to build an app that does X, Y and Z.” It’s a nonprofit. For them to talk about an app and saying we’re gonna invest 1,000s of dollars is pretty staggering. But I think that’s the pandemic, in a nutshell. Where it’s forcing folks to have a whole new playbook or approach that didn’t exist before.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you seen a lot more companies, outsourcing their tech and getting more comfortable working with you since remote work has increased?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s been a plethora of Fortune 500 companies who reached out to us. I’ve noticed some are companies who I think cut back at costs or were like, we’re gonna let go of our development department for this segment, let’s say it was React Native, but we still have React Native needs so we’ll begin offshoring it, or outsourcing it or finding a team for hire for a specific engagement. I think that’s definitely become a big thing.</p>\n<p>Then I think what you’re seeing too is a lot of folks are realizing what a benefit agencies are. You know, there’s one thing I talk to partners all the time about and it’s there is merit to when you want to hire internally and grow a team in-house, but there are also times where having an agency — having a partner like that makes perfect sense too. For a lot of our partners, where it makes sense is that it’s pay as you go. If you don’t need us for a year, you’re not on the hook for multiple developer salaries, a project manager salary, a UI, UX designer salary, a QA salary. You can control your coffin. The liability is more on our shoulders at this point than it is on them; there’s always risk in business, to build a successful business, but if you made the wrong hires and you’re building a new company, or running a company — that is completely on you versus you hire an agency that falters, they’re legally liable to provide what is contracted and we’ve been obligated to do it right. So there’s also that perspective.</p>\n<p>I think the third thing is you’re also seeing, more than ever, folks trying to get things done as quickly as possible. Where a benefit comes into more established agencies is when you have a methodology they’ll actually be quicker to move because you can jive and you have the resources, you have the process nailed down, you know what you’re doing versus when you’re building a team, rebuilding a team doing it internally, you still have to figure these things out too and figure out how to work well together. But again, there’s no such thing as absolutes. No way. When we talk to people, it comes down to what aligns with your business goals, objectives and, you know, like, I feel like agencies short term can be more expensive but long term saves you so much more money, and that comes from our position but, it comes down to what they’re trying to do and trying to accomplish.</p>\n<div data-tf-widget='MXehi2kl' style='width: 100%; height: 400px;'></div>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>At what point do you think is the best time for a startup to come and work with an agency?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s different dynamics for it to make sense. I’ll give you a couple different examples because I don’t know if there is just one smoking gun to work with agencies.</p>\n<p>There would be a situation like, I have very limited funds, funds to the point where I can’t go and even build a team internally or hire a major agency to build my own product, and I’m trying to get enough of proof of concept because I want to possibly fundraise with it, or I possibly want to go in front of potential users and get preorders or get interest, or I want to hedge my risk before I even build it. Well then maybe doing a non-functioning prototype where you design the app with an agency, start to finish. We don’t touch a line of code, we use a tool like Figma to create the illusion of a working app that can make a lot of sense because one, let’s say, God forbid you find out people are not interested or you can’t raise money off of it. It’s significantly better to find that out, spending the least amount of money than it is to go all in and go do something.</p>\n<p>Then we also get folks all the time who will reach out to us and they’ll say, I’m interested in doing an MVP, minimum viable product, and working with an agency can actually make a lot of sense in that regard if that’s the context they have.</p>\n<p>But I will say, I’ve turned down quite a few folks who reach out to us, even if they have the financials. One of the reasons is folks who might have the money, but you can clearly tell they haven’t put any effort into market research, understanding ideas and maturing the vision. The first thing I like to tell folks is you need to know that you are committing yourself to this thing; you’re building a business. This isn’t a hobby that you’re willing to make just the next five years of your life.</p>\n<p>Then there are folks that reach out to you or they have an idea, but you can tell the idea is still not fully fleshed out. It’s almost like they came up with a key feature, but they haven’t fully well rounded it yet. So one of the things I encourage like, do you understand your market? Do you understand your competitors? Do you understand the logistics of running an app? Because even when you’re done with the agency [it] doesn’t mean your app cost is gone. There are servers, there are APIs, there’s a third party you may have to pay for marketing, customer support, legal insurance, like just all the logistics. Have you put proper follow through to understand it?</p>\n<p>There are different contexts when people reach out to figure out what’s a good fit and it’s going to be, yes, you’re ready to make this investment versus again, I look at like like a fiduciary duty like, I get to do that; you might have the money but you’re gonna end up with an expensive toy.</p>\n<p>It’s not like “Field of Dreams,” ‘if you build it they will come,'” that’s not how it works. I think if you’re looking at the sign to work with agencies you have, I don’t want to say a business plan because frankly I never had a business plan, but you understand the industry you’re getting in, you understand a clear vision of what you’re doing, you understand the pragmatic approach of how you’re going to roll it out. You know who your customer base is going to be, how you’re going to get to them. You have an idea of what your cost is going to be to operate it, and you have an idea of projections on what it’s going to take to break even, become profitable, to scale for the big picture. And if not that, at least have an idea enough like, I want to go to fundraise, or I want to get preorders so I can fund it, like a strategy or even a non-functioning prototype can make sense to hedge your risk.</p>\n<p>So it’s a mixture of those things and this, if in a given day I talked to five, six companies that reach out to us. I’d say three to four fall in the bucket of that they need to go back to the drawing board and really take more time and careful consideration. It kind of comes into going back to a question you asked earlier like “what makes us different?” I think because we’ve done this for so long, I learned a lesson early in my career. What happened when you try to fit a square peg in a round hole, like how disastrous that is even if everyone has the right intention. So it’s like finding the right fit. And to be frank, there’s even another question that comes out of this and what is the right agency partner for people too.</p>\n<p>One thing I tell folks all the time is that we’re a remarkably collaborative company … our partners are meeting with us every single week. We are having Slack or real-time conversations during the week. They’re going to be putting in several hours a week to work with us, on top of what we’re doing, and they have to be ready for that and to be involved and be able to pay attention and be able to context switch. There’s a lot of things that happen, we even do orientation week before we start our project where we literally spend a week before the project begins training the partner on how to be the best partner possible, how to pay attention to understand everything. That’s definitely a big component in that regard. Companies reach out to us, or individuals, like I just need someone for the next three months to build this and come back and say, “Here you go.” That just doesn’t fit in our DNA. It’s not how we’re going to be successful. Or the approach we take from design and development QA might not align with the type of approach that they’re looking for. So, it doesn’t even mean these people are bad or it doesn’t mean they don’t have great ideas but this is part of even finding a good cultural fit from like a methodology perspective. Us as an organization, we’re a salary-based agency, so we don’t bill by our week or month, we really take the time to figure out in advance what we are doing. I’m a big believer in you should know exactly what it’s going to cost and take in time, and what’s needed for expectations setting to get that goal. I just think it’s a really big thing, ethically for us to do the right way. But again, these are all pieces, there’s not one solution out there that fits for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>What else should we know about Chop Dawg?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the set rate is a big thing for our partners, just because everyone’s been in a situation, doesn’t matter if you’re in this business or not, where you’re halfway through your budget and you find out you’re not even a third of the way through the project. It’s kind of one of the worst things in the world. I personally never liked the weekly or monthly billing model because I feel like it incentivizes the service provider to take as long as possible, versus everyone having the same incentives; the same goal. Accountability was always a big thing to me as we created a culture and the DNA as an organization; everyone should be in the same alignment with the same goals, and then have the same transparency and goals and alignment within that.</p>\n<p>As a company, we purposely are constantly just trying to be better and better at what we do. Even today, with my CEO hat on, I’m constantly like, “How can our process improve? What new technologies can we adapt? What do new design trends, technology trends can we be leveraging?” I think that’s probably one of the things I’m most proud of. The fact that we just have an amazing team that I know is like genuinely bought into helping people and it’s cool to see where once upon a time we started just need like, 50 plus people and you see them, build a career here, have families, have kids, buy a home, like have the company create something bigger than itself. I think the third thing is this constant quest. We always feel like although we’re great at what we do, there’s so much room for improvement. And how do you have that lens to constantly just reevaluate nonstop, how to be better, because I feel like that’s our, again, our fiduciary and ethical duty for who we work with and who we work for, to constantly push the envelope to just improve.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class='article-footer'>\n<input class='shortlink' readonly='' title='Article Shortlink' type='text' value=''/>\n</footer>\n</article>\n</div>",

You know I’m not naive. We aren’t cheap because of the service we provide, we pay real people’s salaries, we have everything under one roof, but our job is to produce ROI. Make an asset that we scale for the long term and do it where someone is going to invest money, time and resources into it. You’re going to have the highest probability of success. It just came down to that kind of context. So I like to look at it like it just feels like our ethical or fiducial obligation. In the industry, there’s so much saturation, there’s so much competitiveness, and being around as long as we have, we have seen so many companies come and go. I think the reason we’ve had that longevity is just because we’ve always come in with a partnership first approach — but to be frank, we do that even when it’s not startups and early-stage companies, I just think there’s a huge knowledge gap and we have a lot of things we’ve learned — what to do, what not to do, and we can use that as an area of expertise to help folks we work with.\nWhat makes Chop Dawg unique?\nI think the biggest thing at this point is our track record itself. We’ve been around since the early days, and we have maintained relevancy. If you asked one of our partners, that’s what we call our clients, I think what they’re going to tell you is that longevity allows us to tell people not just what to do, but that we know why to do it that way, and how to be more pragmatic — save time, save energy, but also know what not to do. From being around so long, we’ve probably made every mistake you can possibly think of. Which is an advantage. Once you know that lesson, we can also help folks avoid that mistake. I think the third piece and this is more my personal bias that says this, more than anything, but I genuinely do believe it. We are industry agnostic, we’ve worked in almost every industry you can literally think of. I mean professional cuddling is really in our portfolio at this point. We’ve done it all. What’s cool is you start learning that there are trends and playbooks that work in different industries that can be brought to an industry not done before. It’s such a saturated market a lot of folks really are focusing on, and I just don’t think they focus with the right intention. For us, like I think most people on our team if they could work for free to do it for free would, but you know, the reality of living in a capitalist society. We come in with that, have a background like this is the craft level we do and we get to build things we’re proud of and work with people we really love working with.\nWhat trends are you seeing right now in the industry?\nI think the first thing is using AI. I think, as a user, we expect our products to just do things intuitively for us more than ever before. Social is in almost everything at this point. It’s crazy to think that we’re building social base functionality in even internal apps for organizations. There is not a single app I can think of that we’re building right now that doesn’t have some form of social element involved, which makes perfect sense to me as being social beings, making technology being an extension of ourselves and just more industry niche-based products at this point. One more trend of notice is that there’s a cliche in business called “riches in the niches,” but I think you’re really starting to see this now in the app world, where instead of one app eats the entire world, so to speak, there’s a lot more companies that are focusing on just owning a niche and being absolutely best at it and then having minimal competition — no competitors, things like that.\nHas the pandemic affected the trends that you’re seeing?\nThe thing it has impacted is a lot of folks, who I feel like probably would have been a little bit more hesitant to go build apps and software, are now going in. I think it’s just jump=started the industry, like “Oh snap, we might never have a full office again,” our customer base or user base is less probable to come out, or they have a different type of learned behavior now because of a year living through Zoom and not leaving your home. So there is no direct trend as far as like, here’s these type of apps and software coming. I think the trend is more you’re seeing organizations and companies and ideas come out that maybe would have taken a couple more years to make that jump. While I can’t share who they are because of an NDA, I talked to a nonprofit yesterday, who, if it wasn’t for the pandemic, they would have never been entertaining, “we need to build an app that does X, Y and Z.” It’s a nonprofit. For them to talk about an app and saying we’re gonna invest 1,000s of dollars is pretty staggering. But I think that’s the pandemic, in a nutshell. Where it’s forcing folks to have a whole new playbook or approach that didn’t exist before.\nHave you seen a lot more companies, outsourcing their tech and getting more comfortable working with you since remote work has increased?\nThere’s been a plethora of Fortune 500 companies who reached out to us. I’ve noticed some are companies who I think cut back at costs or were like, we’re gonna let go of our development department for this segment, let’s say it was React Native, but we still have React Native needs so we’ll begin offshoring it, or outsourcing it or finding a team for hire for a specific engagement. I think that’s definitely become a big thing.\nThen I think what you’re seeing too is a lot of folks are realizing what a benefit agencies are. You know, there’s one thing I talk to partners all the time about and it’s there is merit to when you want to hire internally and grow a team in-house, but there are also times where having an agency — having a partner like that makes perfect sense too. For a lot of our partners, where it makes sense is that it’s pay as you go. If you don’t need us for a year, you’re not on the hook for multiple developer salaries, a project manager salary, a UI, UX designer salary, a QA salary. You can control your coffin. The liability is more on our shoulders at this point than it is on them; there’s always risk in business, to build a successful business, but if you made the wrong hires and you’re building a new company, or running a company — that is completely on you versus you hire an agency that falters, they’re legally liable to provide what is contracted and we’ve been obligated to do it right. So there’s also that perspective.\nI think the third thing is you’re also seeing, more than ever, folks trying to get things done as quickly as possible. Where a benefit comes into more established agencies is when you have a methodology they’ll actually be quicker to move because you can jive and you have the resources, you have the process nailed down, you know what you’re doing versus when you’re building a team, rebuilding a team doing it internally, you still have to figure these things out too and figure out how to work well together. But again, there’s no such thing as absolutes. No way. When we talk to people, it comes down to what aligns with your business goals, objectives and, you know, like, I feel like agencies short term can be more expensive but long term saves you so much more money, and that comes from our position but, it comes down to what they’re trying to do and trying to accomplish.\n\n\nAt what point do you think is the best time for a startup to come and work with an agency?\nThere’s different dynamics for it to make sense. I’ll give you a couple different examples because I don’t know if there is just one smoking gun to work with agencies.\nThere would be a situation like, I have very limited funds, funds to the point where I can’t go and even build a team internally or hire a major agency to build my own product, and I’m trying to get enough of proof of concept because I want to possibly fundraise with it, or I possibly want to go in front of potential users and get preorders or get interest, or I want to hedge my risk before I even build it. Well then maybe doing a non-functioning prototype where you design the app with an agency, start to finish. We don’t touch a line of code, we use a tool like Figma to create the illusion of a working app that can make a lot of sense because one, let’s say, God forbid you find out people are not interested or you can’t raise money off of it. It’s significantly better to find that out, spending the least amount of money than it is to go all in and go do something.\nThen we also get folks all the time who will reach out to us and they’ll say, I’m interested in doing an MVP, minimum viable product, and working with an agency can actually make a lot of sense in that regard if that’s the context they have.\nBut I will say, I’ve turned down quite a few folks who reach out to us, even if they have the financials. One of the reasons is folks who might have the money, but you can clearly tell they haven’t put any effort into market research, understanding ideas and maturing the vision. The first thing I like to tell folks is you need to know that you are committing yourself to this thing; you’re building a business. This isn’t a hobby that you’re willing to make just the next five years of your life.\nThen there are folks that reach out to you or they have an idea, but you can tell the idea is still not fully fleshed out. It’s almost like they came up with a key feature, but they haven’t fully well rounded it yet. So one of the things I encourage like, do you understand your market? Do you understand your competitors? Do you understand the logistics of running an app? Because even when you’re done with the agency [it] doesn’t mean your app cost is gone. There are servers, there are APIs, there’s a third party you may have to pay for marketing, customer support, legal insurance, like just all the logistics. Have you put proper follow through to understand it?\nThere are different contexts when people reach out to figure out what’s a good fit and it’s going to be, yes, you’re ready to make this investment versus again, I look at like like a fiduciary duty like, I get to do that; you might have the money but you’re gonna end up with an expensive toy.\nIt’s not like “Field of Dreams,” ‘if you build it they will come,'” that’s not how it works. I think if you’re looking at the sign to work with agencies you have, I don’t want to say a business plan because frankly I never had a business plan, but you understand the industry you’re getting in, you understand a clear vision of what you’re doing, you understand the pragmatic approach of how you’re going to roll it out. You know who your customer base is going to be, how you’re going to get to them. You have an idea of what your cost is going to be to operate it, and you have an idea of projections on what it’s going to take to break even, become profitable, to scale for the big picture. And if not that, at least have an idea enough like, I want to go to fundraise, or I want to get preorders so I can fund it, like a strategy or even a non-functioning prototype can make sense to hedge your risk.\nSo it’s a mixture of those things and this, if in a given day I talked to five, six companies that reach out to us. I’d say three to four fall in the bucket of that they need to go back to the drawing board and really take more time and careful consideration. It kind of comes into going back to a question you asked earlier like “what makes us different?” I think because we’ve done this for so long, I learned a lesson early in my career. What happened when you try to fit a square peg in a round hole, like how disastrous that is even if everyone has the right intention. So it’s like finding the right fit. And to be frank, there’s even another question that comes out of this and what is the right agency partner for people too.\nOne thing I tell folks all the time is that we’re a remarkably collaborative company … our partners are meeting with us every single week. We are having Slack or real-time conversations during the week. They’re going to be putting in several hours a week to work with us, on top of what we’re doing, and they have to be ready for that and to be involved and be able to pay attention and be able to context switch. There’s a lot of things that happen, we even do orientation week before we start our project where we literally spend a week before the project begins training the partner on how to be the best partner possible, how to pay attention to understand everything. That’s definitely a big component in that regard. Companies reach out to us, or individuals, like I just need someone for the next three months to build this and come back and say, “Here you go.” That just doesn’t fit in our DNA. It’s not how we’re going to be successful. Or the approach we take from design and development QA might not align with the type of approach that they’re looking for. So, it doesn’t even mean these people are bad or it doesn’t mean they don’t have great ideas but this is part of even finding a good cultural fit from like a methodology perspective. Us as an organization, we’re a salary-based agency, so we don’t bill by our week or month, we really take the time to figure out in advance what we are doing. I’m a big believer in you should know exactly what it’s going to cost and take in time, and what’s needed for expectations setting to get that goal. I just think it’s a really big thing, ethically for us to do the right way. But again, these are all pieces, there’s not one solution out there that fits for everyone.\nWhat else should we know about Chop Dawg?\nI think the set rate is a big thing for our partners, just because everyone’s been in a situation, doesn’t matter if you’re in this business or not, where you’re halfway through your budget and you find out you’re not even a third of the way through the project. It’s kind of one of the worst things in the world. I personally never liked the weekly or monthly billing model because I feel like it incentivizes the service provider to take as long as possible, versus everyone having the same incentives; the same goal. Accountability was always a big thing to me as we created a culture and the DNA as an organization; everyone should be in the same alignment with the same goals, and then have the same transparency and goals and alignment within that.\nAs a company, we purposely are constantly just trying to be better and better at what we do. Even today, with my CEO hat on, I’m constantly like, “How can our process improve? What new technologies can we adapt? What do new design trends, technology trends can we be leveraging?” I think that’s probably one of the things I’m most proud of. The fact that we just have an amazing team that I know is like genuinely bought into helping people and it’s cool to see where once upon a time we started just need like, 50 plus people and you see them, build a career here, have families, have kids, buy a home, like have the company create something bigger than itself. I think the third thing is this constant quest. We always feel like although we’re great at what we do, there’s so much room for improvement. And how do you have that lens to constantly just reevaluate nonstop, how to be better, because I feel like that’s our, again, our fiduciary and ethical duty for who we work with and who we work for, to constantly push the envelope to just improve.",
